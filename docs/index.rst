MatID is a python package for identifying and analyzing atomistic systems based
on their structure.

Capabilities at a Glance
========================

With MatID you can:

  - Automatically classify atomic geometries into different structural classes
  - Automatically identify outlier atoms such as adsorbates in surfaces geometries
  - Determine the dimensionality of an atomistic object
  - Analyze symmetry properties of 3D structures
  - Find surface atoms of structures
