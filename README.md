Systax is a python package for the analysis and classification of atomistic
systems.

Systax can be used e.g. to perform the following tasks:

    - Given an atomistic system, automatically classify it to one of the
      predetermined system types, such as surface, molecule, atom, crystal, ..
    - Given a crystal structure, get the idealized primitive or conventional
      system.
    - Given a surface system, get the idealized bulk cell corresponding to the
      surface, and the orientation of the surface with respect to the idealized
      cell as Miller indices.

# Example
```python
```
